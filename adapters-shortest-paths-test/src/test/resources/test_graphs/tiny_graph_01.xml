    The test data in this file is based at the data from the following "bsmock" test file: 
    	/tomas-fork_bsmock_k-shortest-paths/edu/ufl/cise/bsmock/graph/ksp/test/tiny_graph_01.txt
    However, some rows have been modified regarding the weights, as below, to produce deterministic results i.e. 
    there should NOT be many paths with the SAME total weights
